## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of defining, documenting, and managing the needs and requirements of stakeholders to meet specific objectives. It is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the development team understands what the customer wants and needs.

Importance in the SDLC:

*   **Clear Understanding:** Requirement Analysis ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of the project's goals and objectives.
*   **Reduced Rework:** By identifying and resolving issues early in the development process, Requirement Analysis helps to reduce the amount of rework needed later on.
*   **Improved Quality:** A well-defined set of requirements leads to a higher quality product that meets the needs of the customer.
*   **Cost Savings:** By preventing misunderstandings and errors, Requirement Analysis can help to save time and money.
*   **Better Communication:** Requirement Analysis facilitates better communication between stakeholders, including customers, developers, and project managers.
