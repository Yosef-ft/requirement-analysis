## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of defining, documenting, and managing the needs and requirements of stakeholders to meet specific objectives. It is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the development team understands what the customer wants and needs.

Importance in the SDLC:

*   **Clear Understanding:** Requirement Analysis ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of the project's goals and objectives.
*   **Reduced Rework:** By identifying and resolving issues early in the development process, Requirement Analysis helps to reduce the amount of rework needed later on.
*   **Improved Quality:** A well-defined set of requirements leads to a higher quality product that meets the needs of the customer.
*   **Cost Savings:** By preventing misunderstandings and errors, Requirement Analysis can help to save time and money.
*   **Better Communication:** Requirement Analysis facilitates better communication between stakeholders, including customers, developers, and project managers.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC for several key reasons:

*   **Ensures Project Alignment:** It ensures that the project aligns with the stakeholders' needs and expectations, reducing the risk of delivering a product that doesn't meet their requirements.
*   **Reduces Development Costs:** By identifying and addressing potential issues early on, Requirement Analysis helps to minimize costly rework and delays later in the development process.
*   **Improves Product Quality:** A thorough Requirement Analysis leads to a better understanding of the problem domain, resulting in a higher quality product that is more likely to satisfy the customer's needs.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several key activities:

*   **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting requirements from various sources, including stakeholders, documentation, and existing systems.
*   **Requirement Elicitation:** Discovering and uncovering hidden or implicit requirements through techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops.
*   **Requirement Documentation:** Recording and organizing requirements in a clear and concise manner, often using templates or tools.
*   **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Analyzing and refining requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and feasible, and creating models to represent them visually.
*   **Requirement Validation:** Verifying that the requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' needs and expectations through reviews, testing, and prototyping.
